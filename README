DDO Build Planner, as adapted by me, is commented to show the setup of the entire project.

This means that any comments or changes of code are not the original project, but simply 
a means to learn from the code.

I don't claim to own any of this, again it's just a testing/learning area.

After this is all notes.

1) It seems like all of the edit methods are actually separate classes. No idea why, but they are.
2) There are a lot of objects for storing information.
